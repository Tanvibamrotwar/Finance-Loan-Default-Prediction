# üè¶ Finance: Loan Default Prediction
## Project overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive Project that includes information about loan applicants.The project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the risk of loan default among applicants. It involves preparing and preprocessing the data, building and testing various machine learning models, and evaluating their performance using standard metrics. The final model provides accurate and interpretable insights, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions. 

## Problem Statement:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk of loan default for loan applicants. The objective is to help financial institutions make informed decisions about whether to approve or reject loan applications.

## Approach:
* **Data Preprocessing:** I started by cleaning and preparing the loan applicant data. This step included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing the numerical features to ensure consistency and improve model performance.
* **Model Building:** I developed a machine learning model to predict the risk of loan default for each applicant. I considered various approaches such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and KNN(K-Nearest Neighbours) , to identify the best-performing model.
* **Model Evaluation:** I evaluated the model's performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the Curve). These metrics helped in determining the effectiveness of the prediction model in assessing loan default risk.
* **Interpretability & Reporting:** I focused on making the model's predictions transparent and interpretable. This involved creating detailed reports that provide insights into the risk assessment process, ensuring that the decision-making process remains clear and trustworthy.

## Business Use Cases:
* **Potential Business Scenarios**
* **Risk Management:** predictive model that can assess the risk of loan default for loan applicants. The objective is to help financial institutions make informed decisions 
  about whether to approve or reject loan applications.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers based on their risk profile to tailor financial products and services.
* **Credit Scoring:** Enhance traditional credit scoring models with predictive analytics to improve accuracy.
* **Fraud Detection:** Identify patterns that may indicate fraudulent loan applications.
